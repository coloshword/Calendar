Event Creation
## Features
Supports many of the available features expected of a online calendar application, including user accounts, creating and saving events, an interactive monthly view, and interactive dragging and event creation.

## Next Steps
While the backbone of the application is finished, there are still things to add that would be nice to have. This includes an interactive weekly view, as well as some style changes to event creation and other modals.
